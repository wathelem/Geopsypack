Start configure script. To get the list of available options add option "-h".
For instance you can change the base directory for installation with "-prefix".
Use "-builddir" option to generate binaries outside the source directory.

  $ ./configure -builddir /path/where/you/want/to/build -pch

When done, build package

  $ make -j 8 -C /path/where/you/want/to/build

It can be installed by starting (eventually with sudo)

  $ make install -C /path/where/you/want/to/build
